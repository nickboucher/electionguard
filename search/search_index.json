We need a base set of data that shows how these different types of elections are handled in an ElectionGuard end-to-end verifiable election (or ballot comparison audits). We worked with InfernoRed, VotingWorks, and Dan Wallach of Rice University (thanks folks!) to develop a set of conventions, tests, and sample data (based on a starting dataset sample from the Center for Civic Design) that demonstrate how to encode the information necessary to conduct an election into a format that ElectionGuard can use. The election terms and structure are based whenever possible on the NIST SP-1500-100 Election Results Common Data Format Specification ( PDF ) and the Civics Common Standard Data Specification . The information captured by the NIST standard is codified into an election manifest that defines common elements when conducting an election, such as locations, candidates, parties, contests, and ballot styles. ElectionGuard uses the data contained in the Election Manifest to associate ballots with specific ballot styles and to verify the accuracy of data at different stages of the election process. Note that not all of the data contained in the Election Manifest impacts the computations of tallies and zero-knowledge proofs used in the published election data that demonstrates end-to-end verifiability; however it is important to include as much data as possible in order to distinguish one election from another. With a well-defined Election Manifest, improperly formatted ballot encryption requests will fail with error messages at the moment of initial encryption; the enforcement of any logic or behavior to prevent overvoting or other malformed ballot submissions are handled by the encrypting device, not ElectionGuard. In addition, since json files do not accommodate comments, all notations and exceptions are documented in this readme. Election Data Structure Elections are characterized into types by NIST as shown in the table below election type description general For an election held typically on the national day for elections. partisan-primary-closed For a primary election that is for a specific party where voter eligibility is based on registration. partisan-primary-open For a primary election that is for a specific party where voter declares desired party or chooses in private. primary For a primary election without a specified type, such as a nonpartisan primary. runoff For an election to decide a prior contest that ended with no candidate receiving a majority of the votes. special For an election held out of sequence for special circumstances, for example, to fill a vacated office. other Used when the election type is not listed in this enumeration. If used, include a specific value of the OtherType element. We present two sample manifests: general and partisan-primary-closed . The core distinction between the two samples is the role of party: in general elections voters can choose to vote for candidates from any party in a contest, regardless of party affiliation. In partisan primaries voters can only vote in contests germane to their party declaration or affiliation. As such, special , runoff , and primary election types will follow the general pattern, and partisan-primary-open will follow the partisan-primary-closed pattern. Open primary elections can follow either pattern as determined by their governing rules and regulations. (As noted above, ElectionGuard expects properly-formed ballots; e.g., it would error and fail to encrypt a ballot in an open-primary-closed election if a contest with an incorrect party affiliation were submitted (as indicated by the ).) Ballot Styles and Geography At least in the United States, many complications are introduced by voting simultaneously on election contests that apply in specific geographies and jurisdictions. For example, a single election could include contests for congress, state assembly, school, and utility districts, each with their own geographic boundaries, many that do not respect town or county lines. The ElectionGuard Election Manifest data format is flexible to accommodate most situations, but it is usually up to the election commission and the external system to determine what each component of the manifest actually means. In the following examples, we will work through the process of defining different election types at a high level and describe the process of building the election manifest. Geographic and Ballot Style Breakdown Each election can be thought of as a list of contests that are relevant to a certain group of people in a specific place. In order to determine who is supposed to vote on which contests, we first need to define the geographic jurisdictions where the election is taking place. The NIST Guidelines present an excellent discussion of the geographic interplay of different contests. The diagram from page 12 is presented below. As the diagram shows, congressional, state assembly, school district and other geographic boundaries project onto towns and municipalities in different ways. Elections manage this complexity by creating unique ballot styles that present to voters only the contests that pertain to them. Different jurisdictions use terms such as wards, precincts, and districts to describe the areas of overlap that guide ballot style creation. We will use precinct but ward and district could be used instead. Contests, Candidates and Parties In most cases, a resident of a specific precinct or location will expect to see a certain list of contests that are relevant to them. A contest is a specific collection of available choices ( selections ) from which the voter may choose some subset. For the ElectionGuard Election Manifest, each possible selection in a contest must be associated with a candidate, even for Referendum-style contests. If a contest also supports write-in values, then a write-in candidate is also defined. Candidates may also be associated with specific parties, but this is not required for all election types. Introducing Hamilton County, OZ To help disambiguate, let's explore an example. Geographic Jurisdictions Hamilton County includes 3 townships: LaCroix, Arlington, Harris. The town of LaCroix also has a utility district that comprises its own precinct for special referendums. Arlington has two distinct school districts. The county is also split into two congressional districts, district 5 and district 7. Harris township is entirely within Congressional District 5, but both LaCroix and Arlington are split between congressional districts 5 and 7. Building the Geographic Jurisdiction Mapping (Geopolitical Units) The Election Manifest includes an array of objects called geopoliticalUnits (a.k.a. gpUnit ). Each Geopolitical Unit must include the following fields: objectId - a unique identifier for the gpUnit. This value is used to map a contest to a specific jurisdiction name - the friendly name of the gp Unit type - they type of jurisdiction (one of the Reporting Unit Types ) contact information - the contact info for the geopolitical unit Geopolitical units are polygons on a map represented by legal jurisdictions. In our example Election Manifest for hamilton County, there is one geopolitical unit for each jurisdictional boundary in the image above: Hamilton County Congressional District 5 congressional District 7 LaCroix Township Exeter Utility District (within LaCroix Township) Harris Township Arlington Township Pismo Beach School District (within Arlington Township) Somerset School District (within Arlington Township) When defining the geopolitical units for an election, we define all of the possible geopolitical units for an election; even if there are no contests for a specific jurisdiction. This way, if contests are added or removed during the setup phase, you do not also have to remember to update the list of geopolitical units. Alternatively, you can define only the GP Units for which there are contests. The General Election Contests A general election will occur in Hamilton County. The county is voting along with the rest of the province, and the county is responsible for tabulating its own election results. This means that the Election Scope is defined at the county level. For the general election, the following sets of contests (and associated geographic boundaries) obtain: The National Contests - President and Vice President. This contest demonstrates a \"vote for the ticket\" and allows write-ins Province Contests - Governor - this contest demonstrates a long list of candidate names Congressional Contests - Congress Districts 5 and 7 - these contests demonstrate how to split a district using multiple ballot styles Township Contests - Retain Chief Justice - This contest demonstrates a contest that applies to a specific town whose boundaries are split across multiple ballot styles School District Contests - School Board - these contests demonstrate contests with multiple selections ( n-of-m ) and allow write-ins School Board, and Utility district referendum to show ballot style splits Utility District Contest - Utility District - This contest demonstrates a referendum-style contest with long descriptions and display language translation into Spanish Each contest must be associated with exactly ONE electoralDistrictId . The electoralDistrictId field on the contest is populated with the objectId of the associated Geopolitical Unit (e.g. the Contest congress-district-7-contest has the electoralDistrictId congress-district-7 Each contest must also define a sequenceOrder . the sequence order is an indexing mechanism used internally. It is not the sequence that the contests are displayed to the user . The order in which contests are displayed to the user is up to the implementing application. The General Election Ballot Styles A ballot style is the set of contests that a specific voter should see on their ballot for a given location. The ballot style is associated to the set of geopolitical units relevant to a specific point on a map. Since each contest is also associated with a geopolitical unit, a mapping is created between a point on a map and the contests that are relevant to that point. For instance, a voter that lives in the Exeter Utility District should see contests that are relevant to Congressional District 7, LaCroix Township and the Exeter Utility District. | Geopolitical Units are overlapping polygons, and ballot styles are the list of polygons relevant to a specific point on the map. Similar to Geopolitical Units, we define all of the possible ballot styles for an election in our example, even if there are no contests specific to a ballot style. This is subjective and the behavior may be different for the integrating system: Congressional District 7 Outside Any Township Congressional District 7 LaCroix Township Congressional District 7 LaCroix Township Exeter Utility District Congressional District 7 Arlington Township Congressional District 7 Arlington Township Pismo Beach School district Congressional District 7 Arlington Township Somerset School district Congressional District 5 Outside Any Township Congressional District 5 LaCroix Township Congressional District 5 Harris Township Congressional District 5 Arlington Township Pismo Beach School district Congressional District 5 Arlington Township Somerset School district By defining all of the possible ballot styles and all of the possible geopolitical units, we ensure that if a contest is added or removed, we only have to make sure the contest is correct. We do not have to modify the list of geopolitical units or ballot styles. Data Flexibility The relationship between a ballot style and the contests that are displayed on it are subjective to the implementing application. This example is just one way to define this relationship that is purposefully verbose. For instance, in our example we define a geopolitical unit as a set of overlapping polygons, and a ballot style as the intersection of those polygons at a specific point. This is a top-down approach. Alternatively, we could have defined a geopolitical unit as the intersection area of those polygons and mapped one ballot style to each geopolitical unit 1 to 1. for instance, instead of defining a single GP Unit each for: Congressional District 5, Congressional District 7, LaCroix Township, Exeter Utility district, etc; we could have instead defined the GP Units as: Congressional District 5 No Township Congressional District 7 No Township Congressional District 5 inside LaCroix Congressional District 5 Inside LaCroix and Exeter, etc. Then, instead of each Ballot Style having multiple GP Units, each ballot style would have applied to exactly one GP Unit. Data Validation When the election Manifest is loaded into ElectionGuard, its validity is checked semantically against the data format required to conduct an ElectionGuard Election. Specifically, we check that: Each Geopolitical Unit has a unique objectId Each Ballot Style maps to at least one valid Geopolitical Unit Each Party has a unique objectId Each Candidate either does not have a party, or is associated with a valid party Each Contest has a unique Sequence Order Each contest is associated with exactly one valid geopolitical unit Each contest has a valid number of selections for the number of seats in the contest Each selection on each contest is associated with a valid Candidate as long as the election manifest format matches the validation criteria, the election can proceed as an ElectionGuard election. Frequently Asked Questions Q: What if my ballot styles are not associated with geopolitical units? A: There are a few ways to handle this. In most cases, you can simply map the ballot style 1 to 1 to the geopolitical unit. for instance, if ballot-style-1 includes contest-1 then you may create geopolitical-unit-1 and associate both the ballot style and the contest to that geopolitical unit.

Many of these terms have variants used in different locales. Given the potential ambiguity of terminology, we present this Glossary. It states the precise meaning and usage of the terms used by the ElectionGuard SDK and related specifications and tools. Whenever possible, we used terms and meanings consistent the NIST Elections Guide . Terms Accepted Ballot A ballot that is accepted for inclusion in election results and is either: cast or spoiled. Auxiliary Key Pair Pair of keys (public & secret) used to encrypt/decrypt information sent between guardians Available Guardian A guardian that has announced as present for the decryption phase Ballot Box A collection of ballots that have been either cast or spoiled. Cast Ballot A ballot which a voter has accepted as valid to be included in the official election tally. Ciphertext Ballot An encrypted representation of a voter's filled-in ballot. Ciphertext Election Context The cryptographic context of an election that is configured during the Key Ceremony Compensated Decryption Share A partial decryption share value computed by an available guardian to compensate for a missing guardian so that the missing guardian's share can be generated and the election results can be successfully decrypted. Description Hash A hash representation of the original election description. Decryption Mediator A component or actor responsible for composing each guardian's partial decryptions or compensated decryptions into the plaintext tally Decryption Share A guardian's partial share of a decryption Election Description The election metadata that describes the structure and type of the election, including geopolitical units, contests, candidates, and ballot styles, etc. Encryption Device The device that is doing the encryption Election Key Pair Pair of keys (public & secret) used to encrypt/decrypt election Election Manifest The election metadata in json format that is parsed into an Election Description Election Partial Key Backup A point on a secret polynomial and commitments to verify this point for a designated guardian. Election Polynomial The election polynomial is the mathematical expression that each Guardian defines to solve for his or her private key. A different point associated with the polynomial is shared with each of the other guardians so that the guardians can come together to derive the polynomial function and solve for the private key. Encrypted Tally The homomorphically-combined and encrypted representation of all selections made for each option on every contest in the election. Guardian A guardian of the election who holds the ability to partially decrypt the election results Homomorphic Tally An encrypted representation of every selection on every ballot that was cast. Internal Election Description The subset of the election description required by ElectionGuard to validate ballots are correctly associated with an election. This component mutates the state of the Election Description. Joint Key Combined public key from election public keys of each guardian Key Ceremony The process conducted at the beginning of the election to create the joint encryption context for encrypting ballots during the election. Key Ceremony Mediator A mediator to mediate communication (if needed) of information such as keys between the guardians Missing Guardian A guardian who was configured during the Key Ceremony but who is not present for the decryption of the election results. Nonce A random number used to derive encryptions Plaintext Ballot The plaintext representation of a voter's selections Quorum The minimum count ( threshold ) of guardians that must be present in order to successfully decrypt the election results. Spoiled Ballot A ballot which a voter did not accept as valid and is not included in the tally. Tracking Code A unique hash value generated by an Encryption Device to anonymously identify a ballot Unknown Ballot A ballot which may not yet be determined as cast or spoiled, or that may have been spoiled but is otherwise not published in the election results.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"guide/Glossary/#electionguard-glossary","text":"","title":"ElectionGuard Glossary"},{"location":"guide/Glossary/#overview","text":"ElectionGuard, end-to-end verifiability, and elections themselves use a variety of terms in the conductance of an election, as well as the encryption, tally, and publishing thereof.

Because it is designed to be integrated into both existing and new systems, it needs to be flexible. However, for end-to-end verifiability to be achieved, the following 3 core capabilities must be delivered: The voter is given a verification code they can use to verify their ballot was included in the final tally The voter has the means to challenge a ballot The election results and all its encrypted artifacts, including zero knowledge proofs, are published to enable full independent verifiability by third parties We describe each of these capabilities in detail below. Voter Verification Code A voter verification code is generated by the ballot encryption process of ElectionGuard. It is generated when the user has submitted their ballot to the voting system. Generating the Verification Code Submitting a ballot can mean virtually pressing a \"Submit\" button on a touchscreen voting device, inserting a paper ballot into a digital scanner, or some other event that causes a cast vote record to be generated in the voting system. From a user experience standpoint, the ballot encryption occurs at a point after the voter has filled out all contests they plan to, and has had a chance to review all their choices in a summary screen (or the completed paper ballot). In the ballot marking device use case, the ballot would be encrypted after the voter presses submit. For a ballot scanner, the cast vote record is generated after the scanner has interpreted the ballot. Please note that while the diagrams above show devices such as 'encrypted ballot server', ElectionGuard is intended to be run in an offline environment ; as such, if an API or server is used to listen for or communicate encryption requests, they are expected to be run locally in a secure environment. Once the ballot has been encrypted, the encrypting device needs to handle the verification code returned by the ballot encryption process and present it to the voter, ideally by printing it at the moment of creation in a format easy for the voter to take with them. When the election results are published (see \"Publishing election results\" below), these verification codes are published alongside, enabling them to see that their ballots were included in the election tally (or, in the case of Challenge Ballots, that they were included as challenge ballots (see \"Challenging a Ballot\" below)) The verification code format is a mix of human-readable words and alphanumeric codes. The first word is always human-readable to facilitate a search-like discovery experience (to try, go to our demo tracking site and begin typing 'coo' to surface the verification code above, or simply click the image to be taken directly). Challenging a ballot Encrypting a ballot and generating a verification code is the first step in an E2E-V process for the voter. For E2E-V compliance, the voter has to be offered the ability to challenge or \"spoil\" the ballot after the verification code has been generated and provided to the voter. When a ballot is challenged, it is no longer eligible to be included in the final tally. If the voter wants to register a vote after a challenge, they will need to begin the process again with a new ballot. In addition, when a ballot is challenged, the system must be able to perform a decryption of the challenged ballot and reveal its contents to the voter. Challenging of ballots increases the inherent security of the system, since the system has to assume that any ballot encrypted might have to be revealed, exposing any manipulation that may have occurred after submission; the system can't assume its actions will remain hidden. Individual voters can obtain as much confidence as they desire by challenging as many ballots as they wish. Although they won't ever be shown that the encryption of a cast ballot matches their selections, voters can see that every challenged ballot was correctly encrypted and committed to before the decision to cast or challenge was made. The ability to observe that all challenge ballots are correct thereby provides indirect evidence that cast ballots were also correct. Publishing Verifiable results When the election is complete and the results tallied, E2E-V elections publish the results so they can be verified independently. E2E-V election verifiers are written by third parties according to their interpretation of the ElectionGuard Specification . Any data published by an election should enable each and every cast encrypted ballot to be interrogated and tallied independently. From the spec: An ElectionGuard ballot is comprised entirely of encryptions of one (indicating selection made) and zero (indicating selection not made). Two things must be proven about the encryption of each vote: The encryption associated with each option is either an encryption of zero or an encryption of one. The sum of all encrypted values in a contest is equal to the selection limit for that contest (usually one). ElGamal encryption enables efficient zero-knowledge proofs of these requirements, and the Fiat-Shamir heuristic can be used to make these proofs non-interactive. Chaum-Pedersen proofs are used to demonstrate that an encryption is that of a specified value, and these are combined with the Cramer-Damg\u00e5rd-Schoenmakers technique to show that an encryption is that of one of a specified set of values \u2013particularly that a value is an encryption of either zero or one. The set of encryptions of selections in a contest are homomorphically combined, and the result is shown to be an encryption of that contest\u2019s selection limit, again using a Chaum-Pedersen proof. Once every ballot is proven to be properly formed (as above), all of the votes for each option are homomorphically summed to produce encryptions of the tallies for each option. The final step is then to decrypt these tallies and provide additional proofs that the decryption are correct. Showing Verification Code Results to Voters In addition to satisfying the data requirements for proper verification, any publishing exercise needs to also enable individual voters to query for the ballot that matches their verification code. Verification code results of cast ballots will indicate that the ballot was included in the final tally, and any associated metadata about the device that recorded the ballot (time, location, election, etc.; see example above). Challenge ballots are also published. Results for verification codes of challenge ballots should indicate that the ballot was not included in the election tally.

In both cases, the ballots are individually encrypted and proofs are provided to allow observers to verify that the set of encrypted ballots is consistent with the announced tallies in an election. In the case of E2E-verifiability, voters are given tracking codes to enable them to confirm that their individual ballots are correctly recorded amongst the set of encrypted ballots. In the case of RLAs, encrypted ballots are randomly selected and compared against physical ballots to obtain confidence that the physical records match the electronic records. To support enhanced risk-limiting audits (RLAs), it may be desirable to encrypt the master nonce of each ballot with a simple administrative key rather than the \u201cheavyweight\u201d election encryption key.

ElectionGuard is not a complete election system. It instead provides components that are designed to be flexible and to promote innovation by election officials and system developers. When properly used, it can promote voter confidence by empowering voters to independently verify the accuracy of election results. End-to-end (E2E) verifiability An E2E-verifiable election provides artifacts which allow voters to confirm that their votes have been accurately recorded and counted. Specifically, an election is End-to-end (E2E) verifiable if two properties are achieved. Individual voters can verify that their votes have been accurately recorded. Voters and observers can verify that the recorded votes have been accurately counted. An E2E-verifiable tally can be used as the primary tally in an election or as a verifiable secondary tally alongside traditional methods. ElectionGuard is compatible with in-person voting \u2013 either using an electronic ballot-marking device or an optical scanner capable of reading hand-marked or machine-marked ballots, with voting by mail, and even with Internet voting. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) RLAs offer election administrators efficient methods to validate reported election tallies against physical ballot records. There are several varieties of RLAs, but the most efficient and practical are ballot-comparison audits in which electronic cast-vote records (CVRs) are individually compared against physical ballots. The challenge with ballot-comparison audits is that public release of the full set of CVRs can compromise voter privacy while an audit without public disclosure of CVRs offers no basis for public confidence in the outcome. ElectionGuard can bridge this gap by enabling public disclosure of encrypted ballots that can matched directly to physical ballots selected for auditing and can also be proven to match the reported tallies. About this specification This specification can be used by expert reviewers to evaluate the details of the ElectionGuard process and by independent parties to write ElectionGuard verifiers to confirm the consistency of election artifacts with announced election results. The details of the ElectionGuard Application Programming Interface (API) are provided in a separate document. ElectionGuard Structure In an election, a set of guardians is enlisted to serve as trustees who manage cryptographic keys. The members of a canvassing board can serve as guardians. Prior to the commencement of voting or auditing, the guardians work together to form a public encryption key that will be used to encrypt individual ballots. After the conclusion of voting or auditing, a quorum of guardians is necessary to produce the artifacts required to enable public verification of the tally. Key Generation Prior to the start of voting (for an E2E-verifiable election) or auditing (for an RLA), the election guardians participate in a process wherein they generate public keys to be used in the election. Each guardian generates an election key \u2013 for use in encrypting votes \u2013 and an auxiliary key \u2013 for use in encrypting other data. 1 Additional keys are generated to facilitate sharing of private keys so that the election verifiable data can be produced after voting or auditing is complete \u2013 even if not all guardians are available at that time. The key generation ceremony begins with each guardian publishing its public keys together with proofs of knowledge of the associated private keys. Once all of the public keys are published, each guardian uses each other guardian\u2019s public auxiliary key to encrypt shares of its own private keys. Finally, each guardian decrypts the shares it receives from other guardians and checks them for consistency. If the received shares verify, the receiving guardian announces its completion. If any shares fail to verify, the receiving guardian challenges the sender. In this case, the sender is obliged to reveal the shares it sent. If it does so and the shares verify, the ceremony concludes and the election proceeds. If a challenged guardian fails to produce key shares that verify, that guardian is removed and the key generation ceremony restarts with a replacement guardian. Ballot Encryption In most uses, the election system makes a single call to the ElectionGuard API after each voter completes the process of making selections or with each ballot to be encrypted for an RLA. ElectionGuard will encrypt the selections made by the voter and return a verification code which the system should give to the voter. 2 This is the only point where an existing election system must interface with ElectionGuard. In certain vote-by-mail scenarios and when ElectionGuard is used within an RLA, cast-vote records can be provided in batch without any interface between the voting equipment and ElectionGuard. There is no need to provide verification codes in the RLA scenario. The encrypted ballots are published along with non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of their integrity. The encrypted method used herein has a homomorphic property which allows the encrypted ballots to be combined into a single aggregate ballot which consists of encryptions of the election tallies. Verifiable Decryption In the final step, election guardians independently use their secret keys to decrypt the election tallies and associated verification data. It is not necessary for all guardians to be available to complete this step. If some guardians are missing, a quorum of guardians can use the previously shared key fragments to reconstruct the missing verification data. Observers can use this open specification and/or accompanying materials to write election verifiers that can confirm the integrity of each encrypted ballot, the correct aggregation of these ballots, and the accurate decryption of election tallies.

The members of a canvassing board can serve as guardians. Prior to the commencement of voting or auditing, the guardians work together to form a public encryption key that will be used to encrypt individual ballots. After the conclusion of voting or auditing, a quorum of guardians is necessary to produce the artifacts required to enable public verification of the tally. ElectionGuard has four principal components: Baseline Parameters \u2013 These are general parameters that are standard in every election. An alternate means for generating parameters is described, but the burden of verifying an election is increased if alternate parameters are used because a verifier would need to verify the proper construction of any alternate parameters. Key Generation \u2013 Prior to each individual election, guardians must generate individual public-private key pairs and exchange shares of private keys to enable completion of an election even if some guardians become unavailable. Although it is preferred to generate new keys for each election, it is permissible to use the same keys for multiple elections so long as the set of guardians remains the same. A complete new set of keys must be generated if even a single guardian is replaced. Ballot Encryption \u2013 While encrypting the contents of a ballot is a relatively simple operation, most of the work of ElectionGuard is the process of creating externally verifiable artifacts to prove that each encrypted ballot is well-formed (i.e., its decryption is a legitimate ballot without overvotes or improper values). Verifiable Decryption \u2013 At the conclusion of each election, guardians use their private keys to produce election tallies together with verifiable artifacts that prove that the tallies are correct. Notation In the remainder of this specification, the following notation will be used: \\(\u2124 = \\{\\dots , \u22123, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}\\) is the set of integers. \\(\u2124_\\eta = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots , n \u2212 1\\}\\) is the additive group of the integers modulo \\(p\\) . \\(Z_\\eta^*\\) is the multiplicative subgroup of \\(Z_\\eta\\) . When \\(p\\) is a prime, \\(Z_p^* = \\{1,2,3, \\dots, p-1\\}\\) . \\(Z_p^r\\) is the set of \\(r^{th}\\) -residues in \\(Z_p^*\\) . Formally, \\(Z_p^r = \\{ y \\in Z_p^*\\) for which \\(\\exists x \\in Z_p^*\\) such that \\(y=x^r\\bmod p \\}\\) . When \\(p\\) is a prime for which \\(p-1=qr\\) with \\(q\\) a prime that is not a divisor of integer \\(r\\) , then \\(Z_r^p\\) is an order \\(q\\) cyclic subgroup of \\(Z_p^*\\) and for each \\(y\\in Z_p^*\\) , \\(y\\in Z_r^p\\) if and only if \\(y^q \\bmod p = 1\\) . \\(x\\equiv_n y\\) is the predicate that is true if and only if \\(x \\bmod n = y \\bmod n\\) . The function \\(H()\\) shall be use to designate the SHA-256 hash function (as defined in NIST PUB FIPS 180-4 1 ). In general, the variable pairs \\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\) , \\((a, b)\\) , and \\((A,B)\\) will be used to denote encryptions. Specifically, \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\) will be used to designate encryptions of votes ( always an encryption of a zero or one), \\((A,B)\\) will be used to denote aggregations of encryptions (which may be encryptions of larger values), and \\((a,b)\\) will be used to denote encryption commitments used to prove properties of other encryptions. Encryption of Votes Encryption of votes in ElectionGuard is performed using an exponential form of the ElGamal cryptosystem 2 . Primes \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are publicly fixed such that \\(q\\) is not a divisor of \\(r=\\frac{p-1}{q}\\) . A generator \\(g\\) of the order \\(q\\) subgroup \\(Z_r^p\\) is also fixed. (Any \\(g=x^r\\bmod p\\) for which \\(x \\in Z_p^*\\) suffices so long as \\(g\\ne 1\\) ). A public-private key pair can be chosen by selecting a random \\(s \\in Z_q\\) as a private key and publishing \\(K = g^s \\bmod p\\) as a public key. 3 A message \\(M \\in Z_p^r\\) is then encrypted by selecting a random nonce \\(R \\in Z_q\\) and forming the pair \\((\\alpha,\\beta) = (g^R \\bmod p, g^M \\dot K^R \\bmod p)\\) . An encryption \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\) can be decrypted by the holder of the secret \\(s\\) as \\[ \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha^s}\\bmod p= \\frac{g^M \\cdot K^R}{(g^R)^s}\\bmod p = \\frac{g^M \\cdot (g^s)^R}{(g^R)^s} \\bmod p = \\frac{g^M \\cdot g^{Rs}}{g^{Rs}} \\bmod p = g^M \\bmod p \\] The value of \\(M\\) can be computed from \\(g^M \\bmod p\\) as long as the message \\(M\\) is limited to a small, known set of options. Only two possible messages are encrypted in this way by ElectionGuard: an encryption of one is used to indicate that an option is selected, and an encryption of zero is used to indicate that an option is not selected. Homomorphic Properties A fundamental quality of the exponential form of ElGamal described earlier is its additively homomorphic property. If two messages \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_2\\) are respectively encrypted as \\((A_1,B_1) = (g^{R_1} \\bmod p,g^{M_1}\\cdot K^{R_1} \\bmod p)\\) and \\((A_2,B_2) = (g^{R_2} \\bmod p,g^{M_2}\\cdot K^{R_2} \\bmod p)\\) then the component-wise product \\((A,B) = (A_1 A_2 \\bmod p, B_1 B_2 \\bmod p = (g^{R_1 + R_2} \\bmod p, g^{M_1 + M_2} \\cdot K^{R_1 + R_2} \\bmod p)\\) is an encryption of the sum \\(M_1 + M_2\\) . (There is an implicit assumption here that \\(M_1 + M_2 < q\\) which is easily satisfied when \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_2\\) are both small. If \\((R_1 + R_2) \\ge q, (R_1 + R_2) \\bmod q\\) may be substituted without changing the equation since \\(g^q \\bmod p =1\\) .) This additively homomorphic property is used in two important ways in ElectionGuard. First, all of the encryptions of a single option across ballots can be multiplied to form an encryption of the sum of the individual values. Since the individual values are one on ballots that select that option and zero otherwise, the sum is the tally of votes for that option and the product of the individual encryptions is an encryption of the tally. The other use is to sum all of the selections made in a single contest on a single ballot. After demonstrating that each option is an encryption of either zero or one, the product of the encryptions indicates the number of options that are encryptions of one, and this can be used to show that no more ones than permitted are among the encrypted options \u2013 i.e., that no more options were selected than permitted. However, as will be described below, it is possible for a holder of a nonce \ud835\udc45 to prove to a third party that a pair (\ud835\udefc, \ud835\udefd) is an encryption of \ud835\udc40 without revealing the nonce \ud835\udc45 and without access to the secret \ud835\udc60. Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge (NIZK) Proofs ElectionGuard provides numerous proofs about encryption keys, encrypted ballots, and election tallies using the following four techniques. A Schnorr proof 5 allows the holder of an ElGamal secret key \ud835\udc60 to interactively prove possession of \\(s\\) without revealing \\(s\\) . A Chaum-Pedersen proof 6 allows an ElGamal encryption to be interactively proven to decrypt to a particular value without revealing the nonce used for encryption or the secret decryption key \\(s\\) . (This proof can be constructed with access to either the nonce used for encryption or the secret decryption key.) The Cramer-Damg\u00e5rd-Schoenmakers technique 7 enables a disjunction to be interactively proven without revealing which disjunct is true. The Fiat-Shamir heuristic 8 allows interactive proofs to be converted into non- interactive proofs. Using a combination of the above techniques, it is possible for ElectionGuard to demonstrate that keys are properly chosen, that ballots are properly formed, and that decryptions match claimed values. Threshold Encryption Threshold ElGamal encryption is used for encryption of ballots and other data. This form of encryption makes it very easy to combine individual guardian public keys into a single public key. It also offers a homomorphic property that allows individual encrypted votes to be combined to form encrypted tallies. The guardians of an election will each generate a public-private key pair. The public keys will then be combined (as described in the following section) into a single election public key which is used to encrypt all selections made by voters in the election. Ideally, at the conclusion of the election, each guardian will use its private key to form a verifiable partial decryption of each tally. These partial decryptions will then be combined to form full verifiable decryptions of the election tallies. To accommodate the possibility that one or more of the guardians will not be available at the conclusion of the election to form their partial decryptions, the guardians will cryptographically share their private keys amongst each other during key generation in a manner to be detailed in the next section. A pre-determined threshold quorum value \\((k)\\) out of the \\((n)\\) guardians will be necessary to produce a full decryption. NIST (2015) Secure Hash Standard (SHS).

The public keys will then be combined (as described in the following section) into a single election public key which is used to encrypt all selections made by voters in the election. Ideally, at the conclusion of the election, each guardian will use its private key to form a verifiable partial decryption of each tally. These partial decryptions will then be combined to form full verifiable decryptions of the election tallies. To accommodate the possibility that one or more of the guardians will not be available at the conclusion of the election to form their partial decryptions, the guardians will cryptographically share their private keys amongst each other during key generation in a manner to be detailed in the next section. A pre-determined threshold quorum value \\((k)\\) out of the \\((n)\\) guardians will be necessary to produce a full decryption. NIST (2015) Secure Hash Standard (SHS).

A good source for parameter generation is appendix A of FIPS 186-4 2 . However, allowing alternate parameters would force election verifiers to recognize and check that parameters are correctly generated. Since these checks would be very different from other checks that are required of a verifier, allowing alternate parameters would add substantial complexity to election verifiers. For this reason, this version of ElectionGuard fixes the parameters as above. Important An ElectionGuard version 1 election verifier may assume that the baseline parameters match the parameters provided above. However, it is recommended that the above parameters be checked against the parameters of each election to accommodate the possibility of different parameters in future versions of ElectionGuard 3 .

A good source for parameter generation is appendix A of FIPS 186-4 2 . However, allowing alternate parameters would force election verifiers to recognize and check that parameters are correctly generated. Since these checks would be very different from other checks that are required of a verifier, allowing alternate parameters would add substantial complexity to election verifiers. For this reason, this version of ElectionGuard fixes the parameters as above. Important An ElectionGuard version 1 election verifier may assume that the baseline parameters match the parameters provided above. However, it is recommended that the above parameters be checked against the parameters of each election to accommodate the possibility of different parameters in future versions of ElectionGuard 3 .

Info Note that decryption of individual ballots does not directly compromise voter privacy since links between encrypted ballots and the voters who cast them are not retained by the system. However, voters receive verification codes that can be associated with individual encrypted ballots, so any group that has the ability to decrypt individual ballots can also coerce voters by demanding to see their tracking codes. Threshold ElGamal encryption is used for encryption of ballots. This form of encryption makes it very easy to combine individual guardian public keys into a single public key for encrypting votes and ballots. It also offers a homomorphic property that allows individual encrypted votes to be combined to form encrypted tallies. The guardians of an election will each generate a public-private key pair. The public keys will then be combined (as described in the following section) into a single election public key which is used to encrypt all selections made by voters in the election. Ideally, at the conclusion of the election, each guardian will use its private key to form a verifiable partial decryption of each tally. These partial decryptions will then be combined to form full verifiable decryptions of the election tallies. To accommodate the possibility that one or more of the guardians will not be available at the conclusion of the election to form their partial decryptions, the guardians will cryptographically share 1 their private keys amongst each other during key generation in a manner to be detailed in the next section. A pre-determined threshold value \\((k)\\) out of the \\((n)\\) guardians will be necessary to produce a full decryption. Additionally, each guardian will also generate an auxiliary public-private key pair. These auxiliary keys will be used by the guardians to exchange fragments of their principal vote- encryption keys and for other scenarios in which non-vote data may need to be encrypted. Overview of Key Generation The \\(n\\) guardians of an election are denoted by \\(T_1,T_2,\\ldots, T_n\\) . Each guardian \\(T_i\\) generates an independent ElGamal public-private key pair by generating a random integer secret \\(s_i \\in Z_q\\) and forming the public key \\(K_i=g^{s_i}\\bmod p\\) . Each of these public keys will be published in the election record together with a non-interactive zero-knowledge Schnorr proof of knowledge of possession of the associated private key. The joint election public key will be \\[ K = \\prod_{i=1}^n K_i \\bmod p \\] To enable robustness and allow for the possibility of missing guardians at the conclusion of an election, the ElectionGuard key generation includes a sharing of private keys between guardians to enable decryption by any \\(k\\) guardians. This sharing is verifiable, so that receiving guardians can confirm that the shares they receive are meaningful; and the process allows for decryption without explicitly reconstructing private keys of missing guardians. Each guardian \\(T\\) generates \\(k-1\\) random polynomial coefficients \\(a_{i,j}\\) such that \\(0\\lt j \\lt k\\) and \\(0 \\le a_{i,j} \\le q\\) and forms the polynomial \\[ P_i(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}a_{i,j}x^j\\bmod q \\] by setting \\(a_{i,0}\\) equal to its secret value \\(s_i\\) . Guardian \\(T_i\\) then publishes commitments \\(K_{i,j}= g^{a_{i,j}} \\bmod p\\) to each of its random polynomial coefficients. As with the primary secret keys, each guardian should provide a Schnorr proof of knowledge of the secret coefficient value \\(a_{i,j}\\) associated with each published commitment \\(K_{i,j}\\) . Since polynomial coefficients will be generated and managed in precisely the same fashion as secret keys, they will be treated together in a single step below. At the conclusion of the election, individual encrypted ballots will be homomorphically combined into a single encrypted aggregate ballot \u2013 consisting of an encryption of the tally for each option offered to voters. Each guardian will use its secret key to generate a partial decryption of each encrypted tally value, and these partial decryptions will be combined into full decryptions. If any election guardians are missing during tallying, any set of \\(k\\) guardians who are available can cooperate to reconstruct the missing partial decryption. All spoiled ballots are individually decrypted in precisely the same fashion. Details of Key Generation Each guardian \\(T\\) in an election with a decryption threshold of \\(k\\) generates \\(k\\) secret polynomial \\(i\\) coefficients \\(a_{i,j}\\) such that \\(0\\le j \\le k\\) and \\(0 \\le a_{i,j} \\lt q\\) and forms the polynomial \\[ P_i(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} a_{i,j}x^j \\bmod q \\] Guardian \\(T_i\\) then publishes commitments \\(K_{i,j} = g^{a_{i,j}} \\bmod q\\) for each of its random polynomial coefficients. The constant term \\(a_{i,0}\\) of this polynomial will serve as the private key for guardian \\(T_i\\) and will also be denoted as \\(K_i = K_{i,0}\\) . In order to prove possession of the coefficient associated with each public commitment, for each \\(K_{i,j}\\) with \\(0 \\le j \\lt k\\) , guardian \\(T_i\\) generates a Schnorr proof of knowledge for each of its coefficients. This Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge (NIZK) proof proceeds as follows. NIZK Shnorr proof by Guardian of knowledge for each of its coefficients Formally: NIZK Proof by Guardian \\(T_i\\) of its knowledge of secrets \\(a_{i,j}\\) such that \\(K_{i,j}= g^{a_{i,j}} \\bmod p\\) For each \\(0 \\le j \\lt k\\) , Guardian \\(T_i\\) generates random integer values \\(R_{i,j}\\) in \\(Z_q\\) and computes \\(h_{i,j}=g^{R_{i,j}} \\bmod p\\) . Then, using the hash function SHA-256 (as defined in NIST PUB FIPS 180-4 2 ), guardian \\(T_i\\) then performs a single hash computation \\(c_{i,j} = H(Q, K_{i,j}, h_{i,j} \\bmod q\\) and publishes the values \\(K_{i,j},h_{i,j},c_{i,j}\\) and \\(u_{i,j} = (R_{i,j} + c_{i,j}a_{i,j}) \\bmod q\\) . Important An election verifier must confirm (A) and (B) for each guardian \\(T_i\\) and for each \\(j \\in Z_k\\) : (A) The challenge \\(c_{i,j}\\) is correctly computed as \\[ c_{i,j} = H(Q,K_{i,j},h_{i,j}) \\bmod q \\] (B) The equation \\[ g_{u_{i,j}} \\bmod p = h_{i,j}K_{i,j}^{c_{i,j}} \\bmod p \\] is satisfied. It is worth noting here that for any fixed constant \\(\\alpha\\) , the value \\(g^{P_i(\\alpha)} \\bmod p\\) can be computed entirely from the published commitments as \\[ g^{P_i(\\alpha)} = g^{\\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}a_{i,j}\\alpha^j} \\bmod p= \\prod_{j=0}^{k-1}g_{a_{i,j}}\\alpha^j \\bmod p = \\prod_{j=0}^{k-1}(g^{a_{i,j}})^{\\alpha_j} \\bmod p = \\prod_{j=0}^{k-1} K_{i,j}^{\\alpha^j} \\] Info Although this formula includes double exponentiation \u2013 raising a given value to the power \\(\\alpha^j\\) \u2013 in what follows, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(j\\) will always be small values (bounded by \\(n\\) ). This can also be reduced if desired since the same result will be achieved if the exponents \\(\\alpha^j\\) are reduced to \\(\\alpha^j \\bmod q\\) . To share secret values amongst each other, it is assumed that each guardian \\(T_i\\) has previously shared an auxiliary public encryption function \\(E_i\\) with the group. 3 Each guardian \\(T_i\\) then publishes the encryption \\(E_\\ell ( R_{i,\\ell}, P_i(\\ell))\\) for every other guardian \\(T_{\\ell}\\) \u2013 where \\(R_{i,\\ell}\\) is a random nonce. Guardian \\(T_{\\ell}\\) can now decrypt each \\(P_i(\\ell)\\) encrypted to its public key and verify its validity against the commitments made by \\(T_i\\) to its coefficients \\(K_{i,0},K_{i,0},\\ldots,K_{i,k-1},\\) by confirming that the following equation holds \\[ g^{P_i(\\ell)} \\bmod p = \\prod_{j=0}^{k-1}(K_{i,j})^{\\ell^j} \\bmod p \\] Guardians then publicly report having confirmed or failed to confirm this computation. If the recipient guardian \\(T_{\\ell}\\) reports not receiving a suitable value \\(P_i(\\ell)\\) , it becomes incumbent on the sending guardian \\(T_i\\) to publish this \\(P_i(\\ell)\\) , together with the nonce \\(R_{i,\\ell}\\) it used to encrypt \\(P_i(\\ell)\\) under the public key \\(E_{\\ell}\\) of recipient guardian \\(T_{\\ell}\\) . If guardian \\(T_i\\) fails to produce a suitable \\(P_i(\\ell)\\) and nonce \\(R_{i,\\ell}\\) that match both the published encryption and the above equation, it should be excluded from the election and the key generation process should be restarted with an alternate guardian. If, however, the published \\(P_i(\\ell)\\) and \\(R_{i,\\ell}\\) satisfy both the published encryption and the equation above, the claim of malfeasance is dismissed and the key generation process continues undeterred. 4 Once the baseline parameters have been produced and confirmed, all of the public commitments \\(K_{i,j}\\) are hashed together with the base hash \\(Q\\) to form an extended base hash \\(\\bar{Q}\\) that will form the basis of subsequent hash computations. The hash function SHA-256 will be used here and for all hash computations for the remainder of this document. Important An election verifier must verify the correct computation of the joint election public key (A) and extended base hash (B).

To enable homomorphic addition (for tallying), these values are exponentiated during encryption. Specifically, to encrypt a ballot entry \\((V)\\) , a random value \\(R\\) is selected such that \\(0 \\le R \\lt q\\) and the following computation is performed: Zero (not selected) is encrypted as \\[ (g^R \\bmod p, K^R \\bmod p) \\] One (selected) is encrypted as \\[ (g^R \\bmod p, g \\cdot K^R \\bmod p) \\] Note that if multiple encrypted votes \\[ \\left(g^{R_i} \\bmod p, g^{V_i} \\cdot K^{R_i} \\bmod p\\right) \\] are formed, their component-wise product \\[ \\left(g^{\\sum_{i}V_i} \\cdot K^{\\sum_{i}R_i} \\bmod p\\right) \\] serves as an encryption of \\(\\sum_iV_i\\) \u2013 which is the tally of those votes . 1 A contest in an election consists of a set of options together with a selection limit that indicates the number of selections that are allowed to be made in that contest. In most elections, most contests have a selection limit of one. However, a larger selection limit ( e.g. , select up to three) is not uncommon in some elections. Approval voting can be achieved by setting the selection limit to the total number of options in a contest. Ranked choice voting is not supported in this version of ElectionGuard , but it may be enabled in a future version. 2 Also, write-ins are assumed to be explicitly registered or allowed to be lumped into a single \"write-ins\" category for the purpose of verifiable tallying. Verifiable tallying of free-form write-ins may be best done with a MixNet 3 design. A legitimate vote in a contest consists of a set of selections with cardinality not exceeding the selection limit of that contest. To accommodate legitimate undervotes, the internal representation of a contest is augmented with \u201cplaceholder\u201d options equal in number to the selection limit. Placeholder options are selected as necessary to force the total number of selections made in a contest to be equal to the selection limit. When the selection limit is one, for example, the single placeholder option can be thought of as a \u201cnone of the above\u201d option. With larger selection limits, the number of placeholder options selected corresponds to the number of additional options that a voter could have selected in a contest. Info For efficiency, the placeholder options could be eliminated in an approval vote. However, to simplify the construction of election verifiers, we presume that placeholder options are always present \u2013 even for approval votes. Two things must now be proven about the encryption of each vote to ensure the integrity of a ballot. The encryption associated with each option is either an encryption of zero or an encryption of one. The sum of all encrypted values in each contest is equal to the selection limit for that contest (usually one). The use of ElGamal encryption enables efficient zero-knowledge proofs of these requirements, and the Fiat-Shamir heuristic can be used to make these proofs non-interactive. Chaum- Pedersen proofs are used to demonstrate that an encryption is that of a specified value, and these are combined with the Cramer-Damg\u00e5rd-Schoenmakers technique to show that an encryption is that of one of a specified set of values \u2013 particularly that a value is an encryption of either zero or one. The encryptions of selections in a contest are homomorphically combined, and the result is shown to be an encryption of that contest\u2019s selection limit \u2013 again using a Chaum-Pedersen proof. Info Note that the decryption of the selection limit could be more efficiently demonstrated by just releasing the sum of the nonces used for each of the individual encryptions. But, again to simplify the construction of election verifiers, a Chaum-Pedersen proof is used here as well. The \u201crandom\u201d nonces used for the ElGamal encryption of the ballot nonces are derived from a single 256-bit master nonce \\(R_B\\) for each ballot. For each contest listed in the ballot coding file, a contest nonce \\(R_C\\) is derived from the master nonce \\((R_B)\\) and the contest label \\((L_C)\\) as \\[ R_C= H(L_C,R_B) \\] using the hash function SHA-256. For each option listed in the ballot coding file, the nonce used to encrypt that option is derived from the contest nonce \\((R_C)\\) and the selection label for that option \\((L_S)\\) as \\[ R=H(L_S,R_C) \\] A user of ElectionGuard may optionally provide an additional public key. If such a key is provided, ElectionGuard uses that key to encrypt each ballot\u2019s master nonce \\(R_B\\) and return this encryption together with the encrypted ballot. Ballot nonces may be independent across different ballots, and only the nonces used to encrypt ballot selections need to be derived from the master nonce. The use of a single master nonce for each ballot allows the entire ballot encryption to be re-derived from the contents of a ballot and the master nonce. It also allows the encrypted ballot to be fully decrypted with the single master nonce. Outline for proofs of ballot correctness To prove that an ElGamal encryption pair \\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\) is an encryption of zero, the Chaum-Pedersen protocol proceeds as follows. NIZK Proof that \\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\) is an encryption of zero (given knowledge of encryption nonce \\(R\\) ) The prover selects a random value \\(u\\) in \\(Z_q\\) and commits to the pair \\[(g^u \\bmod p, K^u \\bmod p) \\] A hash computation is then performed (using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic) to create a pseudo-random challenge value \\[ c=H(\\bar{Q},(\\alpha,\\beta),(a,b)) \\] and the prover responds with \\[ v=(u + cR) \\bmod q \\] A verifier can now confirm the claim by checking that both \\[ g^V \\bmod p = a \\cdot \\alpha^C \\bmod p \\] and \\[ K^V \\bmod p = b \\cdot \\beta^{C} \\mod p \\] are true. NIZK Proof that \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\) is an encryption of one (given knowledge of encryption nonce \\(R\\) ) To prove that \\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\) is an encryption of one, \\(\\frac{\\beta}{g} \\bmod p\\) is substituted for \\(\\beta\\) in the above. The verifier can be relieved of the need to perform a modular division by computing \\(\\beta \\bar{g} \\bmod p\\) rather than \\(\\beta \\bmod p\\) . As an alternative, the verifier can confirm that \\[ g^c \\cdot K^v \\bmod p = b \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{g}\\right)^c \\] instead of \\[ K^v \\bmod p = b \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{g}\\right)^c \\bmod p \\] As with many zero-knowledge protocols, if the prover knows a challenge value prior to making its commitment, it can create a false proof. For example, if a challenge \\(c\\) is known to be forthcoming, a prover can generate a random \\(v\\) in \\(Z_q\\) and commit to \\[ (a,b)=\\left(\\frac{g^v}{\u03b1^c} \\bmod p,\\frac{K^v}{\\beta^c} \\bmod p\\right)=\\left(g^v \\alpha^{(q-c)} \\bmod p,K^v \\beta^{(q-c)} \\bmod p\\right) \\] This selection will satisfy the required checks for (\u03b1,\u03b2) to appear as an encryption of zero regardless of the values of (\u03b1,\u03b2). Similarly, setting \\[ (a,b)=\\left(\\frac{g^v}{\u03b1^c} \\bmod p,\\frac{K^v g^c}{\u03b2^c} \\bmod p\\right)=\\left(g^v \u03b1^{(q-c)} \\bmod p,K^v \\beta^{(q-c)} \\bmod p\\right) \\] will satisfy the required checks for \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\) to appear as an encryption of one regardless of the values of (\u03b1,\u03b2). This quirk is what enables the Cramer-Damg\u00e5rd-Schoenmakers technique to prove a disjunction of two predicates. Sketch of NIZK Proof that (\\alpha, \\beta) is an encryption of zero or one After the prover makes commitments \\((a_0,b_0 )\\) and \\((a_1,b_1 )\\) to the respective assertions that \\((\u03b1,\u03b2)\\) is an encryption of zero and \\((\u03b1,\u03b2)\\) is an encryption of one, a single challenge value \\(c\\) is selected by hashing all commitments and baseline parameters. The prover must then provide challenge values \\(c_0\\) and \\(c_1\\) such that \\(c=c_0+c_1 \\bmod q\\) . Since the prover has complete freedom to choose one of \\(c_0\\) and \\(c_1\\) , the prover can fix one value in advance \u2013 either \\(c_0\\) if \\((\u03b1,\u03b2)\\) is actually an encryption of one or \\(c_1\\) if \\((\u03b1,\u03b2)\\) is actually an encryption of zero. In response to the resulting challenge \\(c\\) , the prover uses this freedom to answer its faux claim with its chosen challenge value and then uses the remaining challenge value (as forced by the constraint that \\(c=(c_0+c_1 ) \\bmod q)\\) to demonstrate the truth of the other claim. An observer can see that one of the two claims must be true but cannot tell which. Details for proofs of ballot correctness The full protocol proceeds as follows \u2013 fully divided into the two cases. To encrypt an \u201cunselected\u201d option on a ballot, a random nonce R is selected uniformly Z_q and an encryption of zero is formed as \\[ (\u03b1,\u03b2)=(g^R \\bmod p,K^R \\bmod p) \\] NIZK Proof that \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\) is an encryption of zero or one (given knowledge of encryption nonce \\(R\\) for which \\((\u03b1,\u03b2)\\) is an encryption of zero) To create the proof that \\((\u03b1,\u03b2)\\) is an encryption of a zero or a one, randomly select \\(c_1\\) , \\(v_1\\) , and \\(u_0\\) from \\(Z_q\\) and form the commitments \\[ (a_0,b_0 )=(g^{u_0} \\bmod p,K^{u_0} \\bmod p) \\] and \\[ (a_1,b_1 )=\\left(\\frac{g^{v_1}}{\\alpha^{c_1}} \\bmod p,\\frac{K^{v_1} g^{c_1}}{\\beta^{c_1}} \\bmod p\\right)=\\left(g^{v_1 } \\alpha^{(q-c_1)} \\bmod p,K^{v_1} g^{c_1} \\beta^{(q-c_1)} \\bmod p\\right) \\] A challenge value \\(c\\) is formed by hashing the extended base hash \\(\\bar{Q}\\) together with \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\) , \\((a_0,b_0 )\\) , and \\((a_1,b_1 )\\) to form a challenge value \\[ c=H\\left(Q \u0305,(\u03b1,\u03b2),(a_0,b_0 ),(a_1,b_1 )\\right) \\] The proof is completed by forming \\(c_0=(c-c_1 ) \\bmod q\\) and \\(v_0=(u_0+c_0 \\cdot R) \\bmod q\\) and answering the challenge by returning \\(c_0\\) , \\(c_1\\) , \\(v_0\\) , and \\(v_1\\) . To encrypt a \u201cselected\u201d option on a ballot, a random nonce \\(R\\) is selected uniformly from \\(Z_q\\) and an encryption of one is formed as \\((\\alpha,\\beta)=(g^r \\bmod p, g \\cdot K^r \\bmod p)\\) . NIZK Proof that \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\) is an encryption of zero or one (given knowledge of encryption nonce \\(R\\) for which \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\) is an encryption of one) To create the proof that \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\) is an encryption of a zero or a one, randomly select \\(c_0\\) , \\(v_0\\) , and \\(u_1\\) from \\(Z_q\\) and form the commitments \\[ (a_0,b_0) = \\left( \\frac{g^{v_0}}{\\alpha^{c_0}} \\bmod p,\\frac{K^{v_0}}{\\beta^{c_0 }} \\bmod p\\right) = \\left(g^{v_0} \u03b1^{(q-c_0)} \\bmod p,K^{v_0} \\beta^{(q-c_0 )} \\bmod p\\right) \\] and \\[ (a_1,b_1 )=(g^{u_1} \\bmod p,K^{u_1} \\bmod p) \\] A challenge value \\(c\\) is formed by hashing the extended base hash \\(\\bar{Q}\\) together with \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\) , \\((a_0,b_0 )\\) , and \\((a_1,b_1 )\\) to form a challenge value \\[ c=H\\left(\\bar{Q},(\\alpha,\\beta),(a_0,b_0 ),(a_1,b_1 )\\right) \\] The proof is completed by forming \\[ c_1=(c-c_0 ) \\bmod q \\] and \\[ v_1=(u_1+c_1\\cdot R) \\bmod q \\] and answering the challenge by returning \\(c_0\\) , \\(c_1\\) , \\(v_0\\) , and \\(v_1\\) . In either of the two above cases, what is published in the election record is the encryption \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\) together with the commitments \\((a_0,b_0 )\\) and \\((a_1,b_1 )\\) which are all hashed together with the election\u2019s extended base hash to form the challenge value c which is published together with values \\(c_0\\) , \\(c_1\\) , \\(v_0\\) , and \\(v_1\\) . Important An election verifier must confirm the following for each possible selection on a ballot: (A) The given values \\(\\alpha\\) , \\(\\beta\\) , \\(a_0\\) , \\(b_0\\) , \\(a_1\\) , and \\(b_1\\) are all in the set \\(Z_p^r\\) . (A value \\(x\\) is in \\(Z_p^r\\) if and only if \\(x\\) is an integer such that \\(0 \\le x \\lt p\\) and \\(x^q \\bmod p=1\\) is satisfied.) (B) The challenge \\(c\\) is correctly computed as \\[ c=H\\left(\\bar{Q},(\\alpha,\\beta),(a_0,b_0 ),(a_1,b_1 )\\right) \\] (C) The given values c_0, c_1, v_0, and v_1 are each in the set Z_q. (A value \\(x\\) is in \\(Z_q\\) if and only if \\(x\\) is an integer such that \\(0 \\le x \\lt q\\) ). (D) The equation \\[ c=(c_0+c_1 ) \\bmod q \\] is satisfied. (E) The equation \\[ g^{v_0} \\bmod p=a_0 \u03b1^{c_0} \\bmod p \\] is satisfied. (F) The equation \\[ g^{v_1} \\bmod p=a_1 \\alpha^{c_1} \\bmod p \\] is satisfied. (G) The equation \\[ K^{v_0} \\bmod p=b_0 \\beta^{c_0} \\bmod p \\] is satisfied. (H) The equation \\[ g^{c_1} K^{v_1} \\bmod p=b_1 \\beta^{c_1} \\bmod p \\] is satisfied. Proof of satisfying the selection limit The final step in proving that a ballot is well-formed is demonstrating that the selection limits for each contest have not been exceeded. This is accomplished by homomorphically combining all of the \\((\\alpha_i,\\beta_i )\\) values for a contest by forming the aggregate contest encryption \\[ (\\alpha,\\beta)=(\\prod_i \\alpha_i \\bmod p,\\prod_i \\beta_i \\bmod p) \\] and proving that \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\) is an encryption of the total number of votes allowed for that contest (usually one). The simplest way to complete this proof is to combine all of the random nonces \\(R_i\\) that were used to form each \\[ (\\alpha_i,\\beta_i )=\\left(g^{R_i} \\bmod p,K^{R_i} \\bmod p\\right) \\] or \\[ (\\alpha_i,\\beta_i )=\\left(g^{R_i} \\bmod p,g \\cdot K^{R_i} \\bmod p\\right) \\] depending on whether the value encrypted is zero or one. The aggregate nonce \\[ R=\\sum_i R_i \\bmod q \\] matches the aggregate contest encryption as \\[ (\\alpha,\\beta)=(\\prod_i\\alpha_i \\bmod p,\\prod_i \\beta_i \\bmod p)= (g^R \\bmod p,g^L K^R \\bmod p) \\] where \\(L\\) is the selection limit for the contest. (Recall that \\(L\\) extra \u201cplaceholder\u201d positions will be added to each contest and set to one as necessary to ensure that exactly \\(L\\) selections are made for the contest.) NIZK Proof that \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\) is an encryption of \\(L\\) (given knowledge of aggregate encryption nonce \\(R\\) ) An additional Chaum-Pedersen proof of \\((\\alpha,\\beta)\\) being an encryption of \\(L\\) is performed by selecting a random \\(U\\) in \\(Z_q\\) , publishing \\[ (a,b)=(g^U \\bmod p,K^U \\bmod p) \\] then hashing these values together with the election\u2019s extended base hash \\(\\bar{Q}\\) to form a pseudo-random challenge \\[ C=H\\left(\\bar{Q},(\\alpha,\\beta),(a,b)\\right) \\] and responding by publishing 4 \\[ V=(U+CR) \\bmod q \\] Note that all of the above proofs can be performed directly by the entity performing the public key encryption of a ballot without access to the decryption key(s). All that is required is the nonces \\(R_i\\) used for the individual selection encryptions. Important An election verifier must confirm the following for each contest on the ballot: (A) The number of placeholder positions matches the contest\u2019s selection limit \\(L\\) (B) The contest total \\((A,B)\\) satisfies \\[ A=\\prod_i \\alpha_i \\bmod p \\] and \\[ B=\\prod_i \\beta_i \\bmod p \\] where the \\((\\alpha_i,\\beta_i )\\) represent all possible selections (including placeholder selections) for the contest. (C) The given value \\(V\\) is in \\(Z_q\\) . (D) The given values \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are each in \\(Z_p^r\\) . (E) The challenge value \\(C\\) is correctly computed as \\[ C=H\\left(\\bar{Q},(A,B),(a,b)\\right) \\] (F) The equation \\[ g^V \\bmod p=(aA^C ) \\bmod p \\] is satisfied. (G) The equation \\[ (g^{LC} K^V) \\bmod p=(bB^C ) \\bmod p \\] is satisfied. Verification Codes Upon completion of the encryption of each ballot, a verification code is prepared for each voter. The code is a running hash that begins with the extended base hash code \\(\\bar{Q}\\) and includes an identifier for the voting device, the location of the voting device, the date and time that the ballot was encrypted, and, of course, the encryption of the ballot itself. The hash \\((H)\\) used for this purpose is SHA-256. The tracking code is formed as follows. \\[ H_0=H(\\bar{Q}) \\] where \\(\\bar{Q}\\) is the extended base hash code of the election. For ballot with index \\(i>0\\) , \\[ H_i=H(H_{i-1},D,T,B_i) \\] where \\(D\\) consists of the voting device information described above, \\(T\\) is the date and time of ballot encryption, and \\(B_i\\) is an ordered list of the individual encryptions on the ballot \u2013 with the ordering as specified by the ballot coding file. At the conclusion of a voting period (this may be the end of a day in a multi-day election), the hash chain is closed by computing \\[ \\bar{H}=H(H_l, \\text{\u201cCLOSE\"}) \\] where \\(H_l\\) is the final tracking code produced by that device during that voting period. The close of the hash chain can be computed either by the voting device or subsequently by election administrators, and it is published as part of the election record. Important An election verifier must confirm that each of the values in the running hash is correctly computed. Specifically, an election verifier must confirm each of the following. (A) The equation \\(H_0=H(\\bar{Q})\\) is satisfied. (B) For each ballot \\[ B_i, H_i=H\\left(H_{i-1},D,T,B_i\\right) \\] is satisfied. (C) The closing hash \\[ \\bar{H}=H(H_l,\\text{\u201cCLOSE\"}) \\] is correctly computed from the final tracking code \\(H_l\\) Once in possession of a tracking code ( and never before ), a voter is afforded an option to either cast the associated ballot or spoil it and restart the ballot preparation process. The precise mechanism for voters to make these selections may vary depending upon the instantiation, but this choice would ordinarily be made immediately after a voter is presented with the tracking code, and the status of the ballot would be undetermined until the decision is made. It is possible, for instance, for a voter to make the decision directly on the voting device, or a voter may instead be afforded an option to deposit the ballot in a receptacle or to take it to a poll worker to be spoiled. For vote-by-mail scenarios, a voter can be sent (hashes of) two complete sets of encryptions for each selectable option and can effect a ballot challenge implicitly by choosing which encryptions to return. The initial decryption actually forms the value \\(g^\\sum_i V_i \\bmod p\\) . However, since \\(\\sum_i V_i\\) is a relatively small value, it can be effectively computed from \\(g^\\sum_i V_i \\bmod p\\) by means of an exhaustive search or similar methods. \u21a9 Benaloh J., Moran.

Specifically, to encrypt a ballot entry \\((V)\\) , a random value \\(R\\) is selected such that \\(0 \\le R \\lt q\\) and the following computation is performed: Zero (not selected) is encrypted as \\[ (g^R \\bmod p, K^R \\bmod p) \\] One (selected) is encrypted as \\[ (g^R \\bmod p, g \\cdot K^R \\bmod p) \\] Note that if multiple encrypted votes \\[ \\left(g^{R_i} \\bmod p, g^{V_i} \\cdot K^{R_i} \\bmod p\\right) \\] are formed, their component-wise product \\[ \\left(g^{\\sum_{i}V_i} \\cdot K^{\\sum_{i}R_i} \\bmod p\\right) \\] serves as an encryption of \\(\\sum_iV_i\\) \u2013 which is the tally of those votes . 1 A contest in an election consists of a set of options together with a selection limit that indicates the number of selections that are allowed to be made in that contest. In most elections, most contests have a selection limit of one. However, a larger selection limit ( e.g. , select up to three) is not uncommon in some elections. Approval voting can be achieved by setting the selection limit to the total number of options in a contest. Ranked choice voting is not supported in this version of ElectionGuard , but it may be enabled in a future version. 2 Also, write-ins are assumed to be explicitly registered or allowed to be lumped into a single \"write-ins\" category for the purpose of verifiable tallying. Verifiable tallying of free-form write-ins may be best done with a MixNet 3 design. A legitimate vote in a contest consists of a set of selections with cardinality not exceeding the selection limit of that contest. To accommodate legitimate undervotes, the internal representation of a contest is augmented with \u201cplaceholder\u201d options equal in number to the selection limit. Placeholder options are selected as necessary to force the total number of selections made in a contest to be equal to the selection limit. When the selection limit is one, for example, the single placeholder option can be thought of as a \u201cnone of the above\u201d option. With larger selection limits, the number of placeholder options selected corresponds to the number of additional options that a voter could have selected in a contest. Info For efficiency, the placeholder options could be eliminated in an approval vote. However, to simplify the construction of election verifiers, we presume that placeholder options are always present \u2013 even for approval votes. Two things must now be proven about the encryption of each vote to ensure the integrity of a ballot. The encryption associated with each option is either an encryption of zero or an encryption of one. The sum of all encrypted values in each contest is equal to the selection limit for that contest (usually one). The use of ElGamal encryption enables efficient zero-knowledge proofs of these requirements, and the Fiat-Shamir heuristic can be used to make these proofs non-interactive. Chaum- Pedersen proofs are used to demonstrate that an encryption is that of a specified value, and these are combined with the Cramer-Damg\u00e5rd-Schoenmakers technique to show that an encryption is that of one of a specified set of values \u2013 particularly that a value is an encryption of either zero or one. The encryptions of selections in a contest are homomorphically combined, and the result is shown to be an encryption of that contest\u2019s selection limit \u2013 again using a Chaum-Pedersen proof. Info Note that the decryption of the selection limit could be more efficiently demonstrated by just releasing the sum of the nonces used for each of the individual encryptions. But, again to simplify the construction of election verifiers, a Chaum-Pedersen proof is used here as well. The \u201crandom\u201d nonces used for the ElGamal encryption of the ballot nonces are derived from a single 256-bit master nonce \\(R_B\\) for each ballot. For each contest listed in the ballot coding file, a contest nonce \\(R_C\\) is derived from the master nonce \\((R_B)\\) and the contest label \\((L_C)\\) as \\[ R_C= H(L_C,R_B) \\] using the hash function SHA-256. For each option listed in the ballot coding file, the nonce used to encrypt that option is derived from the contest nonce \\((R_C)\\) and the selection label for that option \\((L_S)\\) as \\[ R=H(L_S,R_C) \\] A user of ElectionGuard may optionally provide an additional public key. If such a key is provided, ElectionGuard uses that key to encrypt each ballot\u2019s master nonce \\(R_B\\) and return this encryption together with the encrypted ballot. Ballot nonces may be independent across different ballots, and only the nonces used to encrypt ballot selections need to be derived from the master nonce. The use of a single master nonce for each ballot allows the entire ballot encryption to be re-derived from the contents of a ballot and the master nonce. It also allows the encrypted ballot to be fully decrypted with the single master nonce.","title":"Ballot Encryption"},{"location":"spec/0.95.0/5_Ballot_encryption/#outline-for-proofs-of-ballot-correctness","text":"To prove that an ElGamal encryption pair \\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\) is an encryption of zero, the Chaum-Pedersen protocol proceeds as follows.","title":"Outline for proofs of ballot correctness"},{"location":"spec/0.95.0/5_Ballot_encryption/#nizk-proof-that-alpha-beta-is-an-encryption-of-zero-given-knowledge-of-encryption-nonce-r","text":"The prover selects a random value \\(u\\) in \\(Z_q\\) and commits to the pair \\[(g^u \\bmod p, K^u \\bmod p) \\] A hash computation is then performed (using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic) to create a pseudo-random challenge value \\[ c=H(\\bar{Q},(\\alpha,\\beta),(a,b)) \\] and the prover responds with \\[ v=(u + cR) \\bmod q \\] A verifier can now confirm the claim by checking that both \\[ g^V \\bmod p = a \\cdot \\alpha^C \\bmod p \\] and \\[ K^V \\bmod p = b \\cdot \\beta^{C} \\mod p \\] are true.","title":"NIZK Proof that \\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\) is an encryption of zero (given knowledge of encryption nonce \\(R\\))"},{"location":"spec/0.95.0/5_Ballot_encryption/#nizk-proof-that-alphabeta-is-an-encryption-of-one-given-knowledge-of-encryption-nonce-r","text":"To prove that \\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\) is an encryption of one, \\(\\frac{\\beta}{g} \\bmod p\\) is substituted for \\(\\beta\\) in the above.

These operations can be performed using a programming language that provides native support, by importing tools to perform these large integer operations, or by implementing these operations from scratch. Modular Addition To compute \\[ (a+b) \\bmod n \\] one can compute \\[ ((a \\bmod n)+(b \\bmod n)) \\bmod n \\] However, this is rarely beneficial. If it is known that \\(a,b \\in Z_n\\) , then one can choose to avoid the division normally inherent in the modular reduction and just use \\[ (a+b) \\bmod n=a+b \\] (if \\(a+b \\lt n\\) ) or \\[ a+b-n \\] (if \\(a+b \\ge n\\) ). Modular Multiplication To compute \\[ (a \\times b) \\bmod n \\] one can compute \\[ ((a \\bmod n) \\times(b \\bmod n)) \\bmod n \\] Unless it is already known that \\(a,b \\in Z_n\\) , it is usually beneficial to perform modular reduction on these intermediate values before computing the product. However, it is still necessary to perform modular reduction on the result of the multiplication. Modular Exponentiation To compute \\[ a^b \\bmod n \\] one can compute \\[ (a \\bmod n)^b \\bmod n \\] but one should not perform a modular reduction on the exponent. 2 One should, however, never simply attempt to compute the exponentiation \\(a^b\\) before performing a modular reduction as the number \\(a^b\\) would likely contain more digits then there are particles in the universe. Instead, one should use a special-purpose modular exponentiation method such as repeated squaring which prevents intermediate values from growing excessively large. Some languages include a native modular exponentiation primitive, but when this is not available a specialized modular exponentiation tool can be imported or written from scratch. Hash Computation Hashes are computed using the SHA-256 hash function in NIST (2015) Secure Hash Standard (SHS) which is published in FIPS 180-4 and can be found in https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/180/4/final . For the purposes of SHA-256 hash computations, all inputs \u2013 whether textural or numeric \u2013 are represented as utf-8 encoded strings. Numbers are represented as strings in base ten. The hash function expects a single-dimensional array of input elements that are hashed iteratively, rather than concatenated together. Each element in the hash is separated by the pipe character (\u201c|\u201d). When dealing with multi-dimensional arrays, the elements are hashed recursively in the order in which they are input into the hash function. For instance, calling \\[ H(1,2,[3,4,5],6) \\] is a function call with 4 parameters, where the 3rd parameter is itself an array. The hash function will process arguments 1 and 2, when it gets to argument 3 it will traverse the array (and hash the values 3, 4 ,5) before hashing the final fourth argument (whose value is 6). When hashing an array element that is empty, the array is instead replaced with the word \u201cnull\u201d as a placeholder.

For the purposes of SHA-256 hash computations, all inputs \u2013 whether textural or numeric \u2013 are represented as utf-8 encoded strings. Numbers are represented as strings in base ten. The hash function expects a single-dimensional array of input elements that are hashed iteratively, rather than concatenated together. Each element in the hash is separated by the pipe character (\u201c|\u201d). When dealing with multi-dimensional arrays, the elements are hashed recursively in the order in which they are input into the hash function. For instance, calling \\[ H(1,2,[3,4,5],6) \\] is a function call with 4 parameters, where the 3rd parameter is itself an array. The hash function will process arguments 1 and 2, when it gets to argument 3 it will traverse the array (and hash the values 3, 4 ,5) before hashing the final fourth argument (whose value is 6).

This has greater efficiency benefits, but the risk of confusion or error still likely exceed the efficiency benefit. \u21a9 If alternative parameters are allowed, election verifiers must confirm that \\(p\\) , \\(q\\) , \\(r\\) , \\(g\\) , and $\\bar{g} are such that both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are prime (this may be done probabilistically using the Miller-Rabin algorithm), that \\(p-1=qr\\) is satisfied, that \\(q\\) is not a divisor of \\(r\\) , and \\(1 \\lt g \\lt p\\) , that \\(g^q \\bmod p=1\\) , that \\(g \\bar{g} \\bmod p=1\\) , and that generation of the parameters is consistent with the cited standard. \u21a9","title":"Validation of Correct Decryption of Spoiled Ballots"}]}
